# HexLight
## A project to create simple, programmable smart lighting.
In the repo right now, you will find:
- In Design/, the 3D models (OpenSCAD and STL) for designing this.
## Idea
Using an ESP32, 3D printed parts, some WS2812B LEDs, and frosted acrylic panels, create some easily controlled, beautiful lights.
I am going to use a strand of 300 LEDs over 16.4ft (maybe a little overkill?) for 8 panels with sides of the hexagon measuring 4 inches.
Code will be added as it is completed. FastLED may be used because I am a little shorter on time than expected.
